# 🚗 Used Car Market EDA – Cars24 Data Analysis

An end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project based on real-time used car listings scraped from [Cars24.com](https://www.cars24.com). This project uncovers insights on how various factors like car brand, ownership type, fuel type, kilometers driven, and transmission influence **resale price**.

---

## 🔍 Project Goal

To extract meaningful patterns and relationships from unstructured Cars24 data to support **better decision-making** in the Indian used car market.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The demand for used cars in India is steadily increasing, but platforms like Cars24 don’t provide structured, downloadable data — making it hard to analyze pricing trends and resale dynamics.

This project addresses that gap by **collecting and analyzing** data to extract actionable insights from vehicle attributes such as:

- Price
- EMI
- Ownership
- Fuel Type
- Transmission
- Kilometers Driven
- Model Year

## 📊 What This EDA Covers

### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Price distribution  
- EMI distribution  
- Year-wise car listings  
- Top brands and models  
- Ownership type, fuel type, transmission breakdowns  

### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- Price vs. EMI  
- Price vs. KM driven  
- Owner type vs. Price  
- Brand vs. Price  
- Fuel type vs. Transmission  
- Ownership vs. Brand share  

### 🔹 Outlier Detection & Distribution Analysis
- Price, EMI, and KM Driven outliers  
- Data skewness and central tendency
